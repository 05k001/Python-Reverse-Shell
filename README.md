# Python-Reverse-Shell
Reverse shell client server model written in python
Still in the works but this should provide a shell on any machine that runs the client script. This is still in the works, feel free to work with it.

As always with Netsec tools. Use at your own risk and I am not responsible for any dumb things you do with the code.
